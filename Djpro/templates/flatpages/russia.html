<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/491708610/vector/russia-political-map.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=iMp1839CKZEEkhPvXuV6SQigykVN9b8h5XR3O36BTpE=" alt="" width="417" height="246" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>history of Russia</strong> begins with the histories of the East Slavs.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">[1]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">[2]</sup> The traditional start-date of specifically Russian history is the establishment of the Rus' state in the north in 862, ruled by Varangians.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[4]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[5]</sup> Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod became the first major cities of the new union of immigrants from Scandinavia with the Slavs and Finns. In 882, Prince Oleg of Novgorod seized Kiev, thereby uniting the northern and southern lands of the Eastern Slavs under one authority, moving the governance center to Kiev by the end of the 10th century, and maintaining northern and southern parts with significant autonomy from each other. The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the Mongol invasions in 1237&ndash;1240 along with the resulting deaths of significant numbers of the population, and with the numerous principalities being forced to accept the overlordship of the Mongols.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After the 13th century, Moscow became a political and cultural magnet for the unification of Russian lands. By the end of the 15th century, many of the petty principalities around Moscow had been united with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Grand Duchy stopped paying tribute to the Mongols in 1480 and took full control of its own sovereignty under Ivan the Great, who began styling himself "Tsar". Ivan the Terrible, the grandson of Ivan the Great, transformed the Grand Duchy of Moscow into the Tsardom of Russia in 1547. However, the death of Ivan's son Feodor I without issue in 1598 created a succession crisis and led Russia into a period of chaos and civil war known as the Time of Troubles. Russia emerged from the Time of Troubles on the coronation of Michael Romanov as the first Tsar of the Romanov dynasty in 1613. During the rest of the seventeenth century, Russia completed the exploration and conquest of Siberia, claiming lands as far as the Pacific Ocean by the end of the century. Domestically, Russia faced numerous uprisings of the various ethnic groups under their control, as exemplified by the Cossack leader Stenka Razin, who led a revolt in 1670&ndash;1671.</p>
